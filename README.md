# MyScripts
Public Access 
This script is written by me to check telnets for N number of hosts and also to check latency by using average ping response time.
This has 2 parts 1 shell script and another supporting property file.

The shell script reads the contents of property file line by line to produce a result of telnet and ping commands.
I had used this to test all the end point URL's in OSB approx 150+ which helps me to be debug issues very quickly whichever were related to slow response or any failures from business services.

The data used in the property file is dummy from 1 of my practise enviornments and not related to any client system.
